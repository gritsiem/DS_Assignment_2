'''
File to run server for seller in the E-Market application
Server
- uses multi-threading to accept multiple clients
- connects clients with the server interface of the application which connects to the DB
- also calculates statistics and logs them:
    - Average response time for 10 function calls
    - Average throughput for a 1000 function calls
